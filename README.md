## Requirements

- Ruby, Rails, Bun, Postgresql, Docker Compose V2

Check your docker compose version:

docker compose version
```

## Initial setup
```
docker compose build
```
```
docker compose run --rm web bin/rails db:setup
```
By default, the following ports are used: the application port is 4000, and the database port is 5435. If you wish to change the ports to match those already in use, execute the command:
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, set the necessary ports in the `.env` file, and Docker Compose will pick them up automatically.

## Running the application
```
docker compose up
```

After a successful launch, the application will be available at:

   * http://0.0.0.0:4000

or on another port you define.
